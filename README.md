Example of using react-native for **android**, **iphone**, and **web**

## HOW TO USE
Because web is still not fully supported by expo *yet* and I haven't had time to fix this:

### Web
```sh
yarn add expo@next
yarn web
```

### iOS and Android
```sh
yarn add expo@latest
yarn start
```

Shocase:


## Web Full size

## Web medium [tablet]

## Web small

## iphone
